Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software Engineering is the proces of designing software applications. It also involves the maintaining the resulting applications.
IMPORTANCE: - For user satisfaction after understanding the requirements and meeting their needs.
            - For bugs correction leading to quality softwares
            - For updating softwares with the rapid evolution of technology.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- The beginning of software engineering back in the 1960s , after encountering software crisis, which led to the introduction of  structured programming and formal models like the waterfall model. This encouraged discipline in software development process as they needed to identify the requirements before design and later on the software's testing.
- Introduction of the Object Oriented Programming which brought concepts like encapsulation, inheritance,polymorphism..etc, allowing the breakdown of complex modules into modular componets and  the aspect of reusability.
- Emerge of Agile Methodologies with regard to the fast technology evolution , hence this encouraged iterations in the development with continous feedback and frequent updates.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements gathering and analysis  > Research on the purpose of the software to be developed from the stakeholders and regarding their expectations. This is done through meetings , interviews and then the functional and non-functional requirements are obatined.
- Planning  > resources, scope , risk management of the software are defined.
- Design > The software's blueprint is designed by creating models, diagrams and prototypes. This is to define the software and how it will meet then requirements.
- Implementation  > This is where the actual coding takes place.
- Testing > Done to check for error and if the software meets the requirements
- Deployment of the software to train the users on how to interact with the software
- Maintenance > Continous updates of the software and scalability part of it as the industry/company grows.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
COMPARISONS :
> Both involve developing the software in phases
> Both empasises on the need of the documentation and well defined processes
> Both incorpoeate risk management strategies
CONTRASTS :
> The waterfall method is sequential while agile methodologies development process is in iterative cycles
> The waterfall is rigid when it comes to flexibility because it follows a strict, predetermined plan and hence changes may be costly while the agile methodologies is so much flexible even in late development stages.
> The waterfall involves the users or rather the stakeholders in the early stages of development while the agile methodologies, the stakeholders are involved all throughout the process.
> For risks occured in the waterfall, they are realizes much later than in the agile methodologies development methods
 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER: >Requirement analysis for a software
                    >Designing softwares, as well as maintaining them
                    > Coding/Actual implementation of the software
QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER: > Quality monitoring and control of the overall perfomance of a software
                            > Test execution
PROJECT MANAGER: > Project planning
                 > Project execution ,monitoring and control
                 > Risk management- identifying all potential risks and creating plans to mitigate those risks.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
> Unified space for both editing, compiling, debugging and testing the code. This icrease productivity as there is a reduction in the development time.
> With the version control systems, eg, Git, intergrated in the IDE's , eg, Visual Stusio Code,it is easier with code revision and code tracking. Such too, enables collaboration amongst the team members and also back up

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Rapid evolution in technology. Keeping up with the new techniwues can be ovrewhelming. However, engaging in continous reading can help. This can be achieved by online courses, conferences, group discussions,,etc.
2. Debbuging in complex systems can be time-consuming. This can however be mitigated by using modern debugging tools and performance monitoring to quickly pinpoint problems.
3. Cyber threats. Solution is to adhere to secure coding practices , regularly updating libraries and dependencies.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
UNIT TESTING : > This refers to testing individual components in isolation, ensuring each piece of code works correctly in solitude. Thus helps in catching regressions early.
INTERGRATION : > Testing the interaction between modules to ensure they work together as intended. Such testing verifies data flow and communication between the components.
SYSTEM TESTING : > Testing the complete system to ensure it meets the requiremnets intended. 
ACCEPTANCE TESTING :> Conducted from the end user perspective to ensure it satisfies the user and is user friendly 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering refers to the practice of designing effective instructions to get desired outputs from generative artificial intelligence models.
IMPORTANCE : > To maximize the potential of AI models
             > To improve accuracy
             > For the AI to perform complex taks

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
For example,," Write something about yourself "
such is som open-ended and there is no desired format or aspect about what exactly about yourself that one is suppose to write , but improving it like ,," Write about your academics in the university and some of the achievements and challenges you faced.." . This is clear that it is you about a certain age in your life where you joined the university and detailed information about your academics.
IMPORTANCE: > Clear intentions and aspect and the scope of what to write
            > Concise- One is able to effectively folow the instructions.
